# ROBLOX Pop-up Remover `[OUTDATED, WILL NOT WORK ANYMORE]`

The `roblox.bat` file is completely safe. <br>
All it does is change the "LaunchApp" value for Roblox's player from "InApp" (which is causing the pop-up) to "InBrowser". <br>
Run it every now and then. <br>
If it doesn't work, try running it as an administrator before DMing me the issue. <br>
